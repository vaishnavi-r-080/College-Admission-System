# College-Admission-System
A  Java Program that helps College Administration with selecting students .
<br>
Brief about the project:
<br>
We have designed a college admissions application that operates based on entrance exam scores. This application collects and manages applicant data, including the following:
<br>
1. Name<br>
2. Mathematics percentile<br>
3. Chemistry percentile<br>
4. Physics percentile<br>
5. Total percentile<br>
6. City<br>

Initially, all applications are arranged in descending order based on the total percentile score. Admissions are granted to students with the highest total percentile and continue in descending order. The application also includes a fee management section to track payment status for students. Additionally, a system is in place to manage and track canceled admissions.
